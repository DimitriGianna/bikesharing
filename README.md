## Summary 

Male subscribers use the service the most and seem to use it to go to and from work. In order to make the service work in Des Moines, the service should provide perks for subsciption as well as have statjions around the business district.
Some additional visualizations that would help convince the stakeholders would be one that compares bike usage between age groups as well as one that compares the starting points of subscribers vs non-subscribers to see how far each group is willing to travel.
